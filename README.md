My first NodeJS Application

This application, similar in concept to my previous Ruby on Rails Wind Power application
will be used to register users to view how many individuals would be interested in renewable
wind energy, still under construction as I continue to understand the stack being used.

This application will be completed using the MEAN(Mongodb, Expressjs, Angularjs, and Nodejs) stack.

Expressjs will be written to assist with server-side development and routing
Mongodb will be used for the Database
Angularjs will be used to construct the front-end of the application
Nodejs will be the structure of the application, also the source of where the libraries being used come from (NPM)

//still under construction!
*Git clone app
*Install dependencies
*Run application through node(node app) in command line until published site is up

Enjoy the app!
